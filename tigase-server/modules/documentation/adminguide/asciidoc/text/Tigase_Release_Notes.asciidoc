Welcome to Tigase v7.1.5!  This is a maintenance release for Tigase v7.1.3 with a number of fixes and updates. Although this guide will forego changenotes for previous releases, we are including major changes and new features list from that version since there are some customers who will be upgrading from older versions directly to v7.1.4.
